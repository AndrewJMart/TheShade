  <h1>Goals Of This Blog</h1>
  <p class="post-date">November 01, 2025</p>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Welcome to my first post! I recently decided to create this blog for a variety of reasons.<br />
To ensure that I hold myself accountable, I wrote this first post to outline what my goals are for this space.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="relight-the-fire">Relight the Fire</h2>

<p>My first computer science experience was a summer camp I attended at Sac State, where we learned the basics of C++ and Unreal Engine to create games.</p>

<p>During that camp, I built a text adventure game alongside a zombie shooter. I remember having an absolute blast and will never forget the excitement I felt watching those projects come to life.</p>

<p>However, when it came time to see other students’ presentations, a creeping feeling entered my mind. Little did I know, it was my first experience with <em>imposter syndrome</em>.</p>

<p>Throughout my journey in computer science, that feeling has reappeared many times. To combat it, I plan on enjoying the <em>process</em> of learning and creating by documenting my progress through this blog.</p>

<p>Rather than worrying about the “quality” of the projects I create, I want to build, engineer, and learn for the love of the field, not just to stack my résumé.</p>

<h3 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h3>
<p>While I stoke my own fire, so should you! Life is too short to compare yourself to other people. Don’t let comparison be the thief of your joy. Enjoy your own journey.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="honesty">Honesty</h2>

<p>Anyone who has met me in person will agree that I’m often very blunt.<br />
So, in true <em>Andrew fashion</em>, I intend to keep this blog straightforward and genuine.</p>

<p>I believe there’s a lot of <em>fluff</em>, <em>misinformation</em>, and <em>mumbo jumbo</em> online that discourages or even gatekeeps people from pursuing their goals in computer science.</p>

<p>Every post here, whether I’m exploring general CS concepts or sharing personal projects, will carry a sense of pragmatism and honesty.</p>

<p>This bluntness isn’t meant to be harsh; it’s meant to provide you, the reader, with a raw look at the journey of a fellow computer scientist.</p>

<h3 id="takeaway-1">Takeaway</h3>
<p>While bluntness isn’t a superpower, it can help cut through the BS. Finding the right sources to trust is important in any aspect of life, including computer science.</p>

<p>Also, the posts I create may, and likely will, have conceptual and or literal errors in them. Learn to have a healthy dose of skepticism and let that guide your curiosity.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="guidance">Guidance</h2>

<p>Though my career in CS is still in its infancy, I wouldn’t be here without the support of my friends, mentors, and partner.</p>

<p>I hope these posts can offer inspiration, guidance, and nuggets of knowledge that you can take with you on your own journey.</p>

<p>This blog isn’t meant to be a complete guide to computer science, no single resource ever could be, but I hope some of my experiences help you along the way.</p>

<h3 id="takeaway-2">Takeaway</h3>
<p>Seek help! Don’t be cavalier or shy, use the resources around you as you mosey your way down the river. I hope that I can provide anyone who reads this with nuggets of knowledge, and perhaps even a good laugh.</p>

<hr />

<p>As a special shoutout, the abstract name of the blog <em>The Shade</em> is a special nod to a special person in my life who inspires me to healthily better myself everyday.</p>
