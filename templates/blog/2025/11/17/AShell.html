  <h1>AShell: A Lightweight Shell In C</h1>
  <p class="post-date">November 17, 2025</p>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p>I have recently been exploring <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/">Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces</a> and wanted to apply some of the knowledge I gained. Early in my career, I was a victim of tutorial hell, relying on videos instead of building my own projects. To change that, after reading the Memory API section of the book, I decided to implement my own shell, affectionately named AShell.</p>

<p>Before starting this project, the inner workings of a shell were somewhat mysterious to me. I could navigate one using classic Linux commands but couldn’t describe how the terminal itself worked. While a full, production-ready shell is far beyond what I created, peering under the hood was an insightful experience. I learned that a shell is simply a process that forks child processes while awaiting the next input. I also discovered that in a Unix environment, everything is a file, meaning you are essentially printing to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stdout</code> in your parent and child processes to display output in the terminal. Along the way, I picked up some concurrency tips and strengthened my C basics, particularly with pointers and memory management, which made the project both fun and educational.</p>

<p>To expand on my previous point, many people, including myself at times, struggle to break free from tutorial hell. As I continue to push myself, I encourage you, if you are in the same spot, to take that leap. Let your creativity shine and start a project on your own. It can be as stupid as an ASCII GIF Generator <em>cough cough</em> . The important part is that you truly challenge yourself.</p>

<p>I also recommend resisting the urge to rely on AI. While large language models are amazing resources, I have stopped using them entirely for my projects. Progress may feel slower, but there is something incredibly satisfying about looking at a finished product you built yourself. Memorizing syntax isn’t the goal, but it is equally important not to become a “third-party programmer” who relies entirely on others’ code.</p>

<p>Push yourself and trust yourself. Spend the time to debug the error messages that come up—it strengthens your critical thinking and programming skills in ways that tutorials never will.</p>
